# Contributing matches

**The short version:** give us a match file, we do the rest.

The easiest way: open the **Contribute** page of the site and follow its numbered steps ("How to contribute" on the site shows them with pictures). It replaces the player names (yours included), the
platform and the time of day by made-up names before anything leaves your computer: a file on GitHub is public at once, so send only its ZIP.
The two ways underneath:

- **A GitHub issue** (no fork, no branch): open a "Submit a match" issue here, drop the ZIP of the Contribute page into the first box, tick the rights box, create the issue. A bot checks it and answers there, opens the pull request itself, and answers again with the links to your matches once they are in the database.
- **A pull request:** put the ZIP of the Contribute page in `inbox/`, as it is, and open a pull request. Your own match files are not
  rewritten on the way: they would publish the names they hold (the commits of a pull request stay public, even after a change).

A bot checks every pull request within minutes, posts one comment (what is new, what is already there, what to fix), and merges it when everything is fine.
By submitting you confirm that you have the right to share the match under **CC0** (public domain, see [DATA-LICENSE.md](DATA-LICENSE.md)).
